# Automatic Roller Blind Controlled by Alexa using Sinric

## Description
This project involves creating an automatic roller blind that responds to voice commands via Amazon Alexa, facilitated by the Sinric platform. Users can open or close the roller blind using voice commands, enhancing convenience and accessibility in home automation.

## Components
- Roller Blind (Ikea Fridans)
- Stepper motor
- Microcontroller compatible with Sinric (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32)
- Amazon Alexa device (Echo Dot, Echo, or similar)
- Power supply for the microcontroller and motor
- 3D printed components to adapt the original product to the customizations

## Usage
1. **Assembly**: Print the 3D component, assemble the roller blind and mount the motor on
2. **Connection**: Connect the motor to the microcontroller and power it with the appropriate power supply.
3. **Programming**: Program the microcontroller to interface with the Sinric platform and control the motor based on received commands. 
4. **Integration**: Integrate the device with the Sinric skill to enable Alexa voice commands to control the roller blind.
